LAMP Server Based Cascading Menu with Drag-and-Drop Organization


I was trying to find a good MySQL based cascading menu..  I couldn't find one, so I put this together.
I'm an OLD sequential php developer so my php may be a bit antiquated.

NECESSARY TOOLS

	-LAMP SERVER (or any database driven page)
	-jquery capability

	
INSTALLATION

1. Clone the directory to your server.
2. Create a database.
3. Import data fields in "sql" directory.
4. Edit "inc/connectvars.php" for your newly created database.
5. Go to the page and play.
	NOTE:  Please feel free to use your own JQuery-UI script, but I included my own build for Demo purposes.
